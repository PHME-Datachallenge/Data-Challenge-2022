Following the detailed description of the schema of the SPI dataset: 

- PanelID: the panel identifier.
- FigureID: the figure identifier. The combination of PanelID and FigureID is the BoardID and identifies the PCB.
- ComponentID: the component identifier.
- PinNumber: the number of the pin considered for the component.
- PadID: the unique identified of the Pad that supports the pins.
- Date: the date when the SPI operation was performed.
- Time: the time ins seconds when the SPI operation was performed.
- PosX(mm): the X coordinate of the pad considering starting from the bottom left cornet.
- PosY(mm): the Y coordinate of the pad considering starting from the bottom left cornet. 
- PadType: the type of Pad.
- Volume(%):  Volume of the solder paste deposit (obtained from Area * Height of the solder paste deposit); 
  the target is tending to 100%; Excessive volume can cause shorts on the pins of the components themselves or greasy soldering. 
  Insufficient Volume can cause a lean or missing weld. 
- Height(um): varies according to the type of stencil (foil thickness); usually the standard sheets have a thickness of 100um \ 130um \ 150um. 
  It is important that the height of the thickness of the weld paste is as close as possible to the target (frame thickness). 
  Excessive height can cause shorts on the pins of the components themselves or greasy welds. Insufficient height can cause a lean or missing weld.
- Area(%):   is the% of the area occupied by the deposit of the solder paste with respect to the area of the opening on the frame. 
  Excessive area can cause shorts on the pins of the components themselves or greasy welds. An insufficient area can cause a lean or missing weld.
- OffsetX(%):  how much the X position of the solder paste deposit differs from the predefined position.
- OffsetY(%):   how much the Y position of the solder paste deposit differs from the predefined position.
- SizeX: the length in X of the solder paste deposit.
- SizeY:  the length in Y of the solder paste deposit.
- Volume(um3): Volume expressed in microns of the solder paste deposit.
- Area(um2):  Area expressed in microns of the solder paste deposit.
- Shape(um): Variation on the regular shape of the solder paste deposit.
- Result: the result of the SPI inspection.
