Data Challenge: 2022
=========================================

In this edition of the annual PHME Data Challenge, participants are challenged to demonstrate the application of state-of-the-art algorithms and models to solve a classification problem for a real production line. This year's Challenge is held in collaboration with Bitron Spa, a leading company in the development and manufacturing of mechatronic devices. Thanks to this collaboration, the competition has exclusive access to an extensive dataset of a real industrial production line equipped with automated, integrated and fully connected machines (Industry 4.0).

For more information about the data challenge and to enroll in it, please visit the https://phm-europe.org/data-challenge web page.
Here we will post information about the data challenge, the data and basic Jupyter notebooks.
